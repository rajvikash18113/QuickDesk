## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/rajvikash18113/QuickDesk.git](https://github.com/rajvikash18113/QuickDesk.git)
    cd QuickDesk
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the database connection:**
    * Create a free PostgreSQL database on a service like [Render](https://render.com/).
    * Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    * Add your database connection string to it:
        ```env
        DATABASE_URL="YOUR_POSTGRESQL_CONNECTION_STRING"
        ```

4.  **Sync the database schema:**
    ```sh
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Start the server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    Your application will be running at `http://localhost:3001`. The server will automatically seed the database with default users the first time it starts.
